# This should be included in Makefiles before the configuration
# include file to ensure that the defaults can be overridden.

# Note that DOCKBUILDFLAGS provides a hook into the build process for
# installers; for example, to build debug versions of the DOCK programs:
# make -e DOCKBUILDFLAGS="-DDEBUG -O0 -g"
# or, for example, to build profiling versions of the DOCK programs:
# make clean; make -e DOCKBUILDFLAGS="-pg"
# which for dock6 would then be analysed via
# dock6 -i bla; gprof -C dock6 |less

# This target ensures that the right target (all) is the default target.
# Originally the idea was to avoid problems due to including this file
# in the wrong place.  But all known makes scan the whole makefile.
# However, AIX's make does not understand .PHONY; consequently aix make
# would treat all the targets in .PHONY as the default target !
